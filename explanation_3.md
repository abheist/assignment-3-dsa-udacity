Have to maximize the sum of the two formed number.
First, iterated through the array then stored the frequencies of all the digits
i.e. 0 to 9.
Have created an array to store all the frequencies.
After creating the array and storing the frequencies, iterated through the array from last & appended the numbers to form the two numbers and finally joined to create the list.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
